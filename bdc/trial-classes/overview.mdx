TODO: Introduce, relevant web pages

On the [trial class](https://www.bergendebate.com/free-class) page, parents first **select the student’s grade range and preferred location (or online)**.

\
Based on this selection, available trial classes are shown. Once a trial class is selected, the parent can **register for the trial class**. After successful registration, a **confirmation email is sent** with the class details.

Give explanation & guides here for all non-technical admins (Retool + management via Acuity).

## Trial Class Details

The [trial class details](https://bergendebate.retool.com/editor/41fed58a-42df-11f0-bba5-fbecf1466f1d/2025%20Phase%20B/trial_class_details/page1) page shows a complete list of all **trial class bookings**. You can **search and filter** records by parent, date, attendance, and status.

For each trial class, it displays **parent and student details**, **class type**, **scheduled date & time**, and whether emails were sent. You can also **view email logs, add notes**, and **mark a trial as purchased or unpurchased**.

## Trial Class Email Automation

[This](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/a9f49b14-7e96-11f0-b537-dfd369c571eb/2025%20Phase%20B/Trial%20Class%20Email%20Automation/page1) page is used to manage **Trial Class automation**. Based on the trial class status (Attended or Non-Attended), different **email steps and follow-ups** are configured.

\
Each step allows you to set the time delay, email subject, content, and Active/Inactive status so that parents receive the right communication at the right time.

In the **Attended** case, the automation step is currently set to **Inactive**, so the email does not get triggered even after the trial is attended.\
Whereas in the **Non-Attended** case, the automation is marked **Active**, which is why it is working and emails are being sent.
