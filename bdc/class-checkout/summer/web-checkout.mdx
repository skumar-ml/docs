TODO: Give a technical explanation of how checkout page works (before payment). Explain things that are materially different than how we do them on the semester checkout end. Else, just reference the APIs/codes that accomplish the functionality.

Things to explain are the sign-up / log-in redirect, how session & locations are added in, the number of spots calculation, the code & triggers for code for PF Labs, how Model UN & Young Entreneurship are combined.

<Warning>
  TODO: Need to add the following

  1. Saved student profiles (similar to semester)
  2. Order session display numerically. This can be done now itself
  3.

## Checkout System

TODO: For all of these, reference logics that are similar to semester checkout. Specifically highlight logic that is unique to summer.
