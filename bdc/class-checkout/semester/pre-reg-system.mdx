## Admin Details

TODO: Give a non-technical explanation of all the different states for the pre-reg system, and how they can be controlled via Retool

The pre-registration system controls how and when students with **year-long bundle programs** can register early for upcoming semesters at discounted rates.

This document explains:

- The different pre-registration states
- What users see in each state
- How admins can control and manage these states using Retool

---

## Overview

Pre-registration allows eligible students to:

- Register earlier than general enrollment
- Access discounted pricing
- Secure class spots before regular registration opens

The system automatically places each user into the correct state based on **timing** and **bundle ownership**.

---

## The Three Pre-Registration States

### 1. Normal Registration State

#### What This Means

## How the System Determines the State

The system automatically checks:

1. **Pre-Registration Dates**
   - Has pre-registration started?
   - Has it ended?
2. **Bundle Ownership**
   - Does the user have a year-long bundle?
   - Has pre-registration already been completed?
3. **Student Matching**
   - Does the student name match a bundle record?
   - Is the student eligible for early registration?

No manual action is required by users—state selection happens automatically.

## Common Scenarios

| Scenario                         | State                 | User Experience                       |
| :------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| New user during pre-reg          | Pre-Registration Info | Sees upgrade and discount info        |
| Bundle owner, not pre-registered | Pre-Registration Info | Prompted to complete pre-registration |
| Bundle owner, pre-registered     | Bundle Purchase       | Can checkout with discount            |
| After pre-reg ends               | Normal                | Standard registration                 |
| Before pre-reg starts            | Normal                | Standard registration                 |

---

## Retool: Admin Control & Management

Admins manage pre-registration behavior through **Retool**.

### Bundle Management Program Page

In Retool, admins can:

- Add new bundle programs
- Switch students between bundle programs
- Remove students from bundle programs
- Correct student-bundle mismatches

These actions directly affect which pre-registration state a user sees.

 \<Note\> Changes made in Retool take effect immediately and determine whether users see pre-registration messaging or discounted checkout. \</Note\> 

---

## Important Notes

- State changes are automatic and time-based
- Student names must match bundle records
- Pre-registration windows are strictly enforced
- Discounts apply only during the active pre-registration period
- Supplementary programs can be added only in the Bundle Purchase state

---

## Summary

The pre-registration system has three clear states:

1. **Normal Registration** – Standard experience for all users
2. **Pre-Registration Information** – Awareness and upgrade opportunity
3. **Bundle Purchase** – Discounted checkout and early access

**In retool, we have a bundle management program page there user can add, switch, and delete the bundle program**

## Technical Details

TODO: Give a technical explanation of how these states are calculated for each user. How the user can "auto-enroll" without making a payment.
