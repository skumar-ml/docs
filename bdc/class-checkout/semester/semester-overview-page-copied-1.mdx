## Non-Technical: Checkout Flow

The checkout flow follows a **multi-step form**:

**\<TODO\>:** This misses the parent account creation or login step

1. Student Details
2. Optional Bundle Program Selection
3. Class Selection & Payment

Each step must be completed before moving to the next.

### Step 1: Student Details

Parents begin by entering or selecting student information.

**Saved Student Profiles**: A dropdown allows parents to select an existing student profile. Selecting a saved student automatically fills in the form fields.

**Student Information Fields**:

- First & Last Name
- Email Address
  - If the student does not have an email, the parent’s email can be used.
- Student Grade, School, & Gender
- Has your child participated in a BDC class before?

**Next Button**

- Clicking **Next** saves the student information.
- After saving, a popup appears to offer discounted bundle programs for future sessions.

### Step 2: Bundle Program (Optional)

A popup appears allowing families to pre-register for future sessions at a discounted rate.

**Bundle Options:** Users can select one or more future sessions to bundle.

**Skipping the Bundle:** Users can skip this step by clicking **“No Thanks”**. The checkout process continues whether or not a bundle is selected.

### Step 3: Class Selection & Payment

**Select Class Location:** Users must first choose a location (e.g., Glen Rock, Fort Lee, Livingston, Online)

**Select Class Time:** Available time slots appear after selecting a location. Example times:

- Friday 4:00 PM – 6:00 PM
- Sunday 9:30 AM – 11:30 AM

**Seat Availability Messages**

Depending on how many spots are left in the class, users may see messages such as:

- **Limited Availability:** "Hurry! Register now. Seats filling up fast! Only 1 spot left.”
- **Sold Out:** “Seats are full. You can fill out the waitlist form below.”
- “Seats are full. Please fill out the waitlist form.”

<Warning>
  TODO: What is the difference (in trigger conditions between the bottom two)? We should note all potential messages the user may see, as well as what the trigger is
</Warning>

## Payment Options

Payment options become available once a class time and location are selected and seats are available. We support **Bank Transfer** and **Credit Card** payment methods. To pay, users:

1. Select a payment method & click **Buy Now**.
3. They are **redirected to a secure Stripe checkout page**, where they enter payment details & complete payment

### After Payment

Upon successful payment, the user is redirected to a confirmation (success) page. The student is officially registered for the class.

TODO: Hyperlink the confimration page...

## Additional UI Elements of Checkout Flow

**Bundle Program Banner:** On the class level & location select screen. This displays the currently (if there are any) selected bundle programs. It allows users to add or remove their selections prior to payment.

**Bergen Briefs:** On the right-hand sidebar, optional learning briefs can be added alongside class registration. Users can choose full or light versions.

**Student Info Panel:** Displays the selected student’s information for confirmation.

TODO: Does it allow for editing? Or just display?

**Order Details Panel:** Shows:

- selected class level, time and location
- any upsells (bundle future semesters or briefs)
- pricing and totals

NOTE: This dynamically updates based on payment method (adding or removing the bank transfer discount)
