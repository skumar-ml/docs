Our stack is as follows:

- **Webflow:** front-end website platform
- **MongoDB:** database
- **Retool:** internal admin portal
- **JS hosted on GitHub:** files to help with dynamic rendering for Webflow
- **Python APIs hosted on AWS:** scripts to communicate between Webflow & MongoDB
- **Memberstack:** member software for Webflow
- **Zapier:** simple, no-code automations

We also have other important tech components that augment our stack:

- **JavaScript files:** Frontend files that make API calls and dynamically render content on our Webflow site. These are [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/skumar-ml/bcdc_aws).
- **Python APIs:** Our APIs are written in Python. They are hosted on AWS as Lambda functions, and made available via the API Gateway. A copy is kept up-to-date [on GitHub](https://github.com/skumar-ml/bcdc_aws).
