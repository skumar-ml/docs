## Admins

Admins can edit parent, student, and coach information using Retool. The editing flow differs depending on whether the person already has a Memberstack account or exists only in the database.

<Danger>
  TODO: Can we consolidate this functionality, now that we have records for folks that don't have accounts on memberstack? Or do we need to
</Danger>

### Overview

There are two types of accounts. Retool routes admins to different edit flows based on this distinction:

- **Full Accounts** that exist in Memberstack (active user accounts)
- **Partial Accounts** that do not exist in Memberstack (stored only in the database)
  - These are created when we obtain partial user information from any of our lead sources (e.g., trial classes)

### Case 1: Editing from the Student Registration Details Page

Admins can click **Edit** on the student registration details page. If the account to be edited is a **Full Account**, the admin is redirect to the [**Edit Member Retool page**](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/6cb9bfae-69e8-11ef-bb6b-d317bde55ef7/2024%20phase%202/Edit%20Member%20Info). For **Partial Accounts**, admin are redirected to [**an alternate Retool edit page**](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/063ef750-690f-11ef-825c-671fc9b2d80a/2024%20phase%202/Update%20Not%20Signup%20Student%20Data?paymentId=648cc5c3da7f24ff809f910b&returnPage=Academic)**.**

**Editable Fields**

- **Parent / Coach:** First & Last Name, Email, Phone Number
- **Student:** First & Last Name, Email

### Case 2: Directly Editing via Retool

If the member is not accesible via the Student Registration Details, admin can directly access the Retool pages for editing. The steps are:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the edit page for Full Accounts">
    [On this Retool page](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/6cb9bfae-69e8-11ef-bb6b-d317bde55ef7/2024%20phase%202/Edit%20Member%20Info), search for the user you want to edit. If found proceed to edit as appropriate. Else, proceed to Step 2.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access the edit page for Partial Accounts">
    [On this Retool page](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/063ef750-690f-11ef-825c-671fc9b2d80a/2024%20phase%202/Update%20Not%20Signup%20Student%20Data?paymentId=648cc5c3da7f24ff809f910b&returnPage=Academic), search for the Partial Account via name or email. Edit as appropriate.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  TODO: We need to change the edit page for Partial Accounts to include a search functionality. Users must search for Partial Accounts existing in the Members Collection, and only edit those.
</Warning>

### Key Differences: Existing vs Non-Existing Accounts

| Feature               | Existing Account | No Account          |
| :-------------------- | :--------------- | :------------------ |
| Memberstack Record    | Yes              | No                  |
| Retool Page           | Edit Member Page | Alternate Edit Page |
| Lambda Function       | Yes              | No                  |
| Database Update       | Yes              | Yes                 |
| Account Login Enabled | Yes              | No                  |

### Technical Details

TODO: Give very brief technical details of which Lambda functions get called..

To execute edits for **Full Accounts**, Retool calls a **Lambda function** to update the member in Memberstack and sync the database. In Retool, we triggered the lambda function **updateMember** **API** to update the member in all three places: Memberstack, Webflow, and MongoDB.

For **Partial Accounts**, Retool directly updates the **member collection in MongoDB only**.

<Note>
  The Partial Account flow is used for pre-registered students or records created before account creation.

  TODO: Not sure I understand this fully. Let's revisit when the section is fully flushed out.

## Users

<Note>
  Users cannot currently make edits to their own accounts. This is contemplated future functionality. Once implemented, this section will be filled out.
