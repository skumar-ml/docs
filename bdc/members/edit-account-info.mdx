# Admins

TODO: Explain how admins can edit account info on Retool. Explain the difference between editing info for accounts that do and do not exist. Also, can we update/consolidate this functionality, now that we have records for folks that don't have accounts on memberstack? We should also confirm this Retool page functionality works with the DB changes we've made

# Users

TODO: Fill this out. Can users even make account edits on BDC? Confirm yes or no...
