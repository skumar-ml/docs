title: "Creating an Account"
---

## How-To

1. Navigate to the sign-up page.
2. Fill in required fields (and provide a <u>valid email address</u>) **\<TODO\>**
5. Create a password.
6. Submit the form to create your account.

The platform supports multiple account types to ensure proper role-based access and family linking.

### Parent Accounts

**Required Fields:** First & Last Name, Email Address

### Student Accounts

**Required Fields:** First & Last Name, Parent Name &  Email Address

**Note:** The parent email address is used to link the student account to a parent account via the `familyId`.

### Coach Accounts

**Required Fields:** First & Last Name, Email Address

<Warning>
  There is no way for an admin to create an account for a user. This is contemplated future functionality. If such a need arises, let the tech team know, and we can manually do this
</Warning>

## Technical Details

TODO:

To create an account, we do the following:

1. What APIs get called, and what function do they serve. Brief sketch of logic, and the other services that get
2. What does the MongoDB schema look like for a created account
3. Add in any differences in the flow for parent vs student vs coach accounts

## Technical Steps Involved in Account Creation

**1: Memberstack**

**TODO:** We need to add a step before this that talks about Memberstack inserting the record into their database. How do we ensure this record has been inserted before we call createUserSignup?

### 1.1 `POST /camp/createUserSignup `

<Note>
  TODO: Why is it /camp/?
</Note>

Entry-point API to initiate account signup and synchronize data between Webflow & Memberstack.

**Responsibilities:**

- Accepts signup payload: `name`, `email`, `accountType` (student | parent | coach), `signUpRef`
  - TODO: Eventually, we'll just point to the OpenAPI reference for input payload signature...
- **Webflow Insertion:** Formats the payload into Webflow's CMS-compatible structure. Inserts into Webflow CMS's **Member** collection and publishes the CMS item.
- **Webflow ↔ Memberstack linkage:** Receives `itemId` from Webflow in the response. Finds member in Memberstack via the payload's `memberId`.  Updates Memberstack record with `webflow-member-id = itemId` .
- Invokes `createAccount` service to persist data into MongoDB, with different arguments passed depending on if sign-up was from `student` or `parent`.
- TODO: Also discuss CRM and Referral related code

**Services Used:**

<Note>
  TODO: This type of Services Used is not that useful. Should all be implicitly covered or mentioned in the "Responsiblities".
</Note>

### 1.2 `POST /camp/createAccount`

Creates or updates the user account record in MongoDB, based on if `student` or `parent` data was passed in.

**Responsibilities:**

- If **student or parent records already exist** without a `memberId`:
  - Updates the existing record with: `memberId`, `itemId`, `name`, `email`
- Else, creates a new record for the student or parent.
  - If record is a `student`, then link to the `parent` record (which is also created, if does not exist)
  - **TODO**: Discuss `familyId` logic
- **TODO:** Where is AWS SES triggered from?

## 2. Brief Sketch of Logic & Services Involved

**TODO:** Note, this sketch is generally not that useful. It should be all encompassed above. Please delete this section after reading. The Post-Signup actions should be included above.

### End-to-End Logic (High Level)

1. **User submits signup** (webflow form/cart/ invite)
2. `POST /camp/createUserSignup`
   - Validates payload
   - Transforms data into Webflow CMS format
   - Creates & publishes Webflow item
   - Receives `itemId`
   - Updates Memberstack user with `webflow-member-id = itemId`
3. **CreateAccount service invoked**
   - Normalizes payload
   - Determines accountType (student/parent/coach)
   - Creates or updates the MongoDB account record
4. **Post-signup actions**
   - Confirmation email sent
   - User allowed to continue login/checkout

### Services & Systems Touched

**TODO:** Note, this similarly is not that useful. Please delete after reading

- **API Gateway / Backend**
  - Orchestrates signup flow
- **Webflow CMS**
  - Stores CMS-facing account data
  - Acts as published content source
- **Memberstack**
  - Authentication & membership management
  - Linked to Webflow via `webflow-member-id`
- **MongoDB**
  - System-of-record for account profiles
  - Supports partial pre-created records
- **CreateAccount Service**
  - Centralized account creation & update logic
- **AWS SES (Email)**
  - Signup confirmation & notifications

## 3. MongoDB Account Schema

TODO: For SK to review after above is finalized.

### 3.1 Account Document (Common Structure)

```
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "name": "Full Name",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "itemId": "webflow_item_id",
  "familyId": "family_identifier",
  "accountType": "student | parent | coach",
  "memberId": "memberstack_member_id",
  "firstName": "First",
  "lastName": "Last",
  "createdOn": ISODate,
  "updatedOn": ISODate,
  "utm_source": "",
  "signUpRef": ""
}
```

---

### 3.2 Student Account Example

```
{
  "name": "Diksha Singh",
  "email": "diksha.singh@techment.com",
  "itemId": "",
  "familyId": "r8tt097r1D58i1ti",
  "accountType": "student",
  "memberId": "",
  "firstName": "Diksha",
  "lastName": "Singh",
  "school": "ABC-10",
  "studentGrade": "6th Grade",
  "gender": "Female",
  "dob": "",
  "createdOn": "2026-01-14T06:51:34.477Z",
  "updatedOn": "2026-01-14T07:18:33.222Z",
  "utm_source": "",
  "signUpRef": ""
}
```

---

### 3.3 Student Account (Signup from Cart)

```
{
  "name": "Rahul Student",
  "email": "rahul.student@techment.com",
  "itemId": "",
  "familyId": "",
  "accountType": "student",
  "memberId": "",
  "firstName": "Rahul",
  "lastName": "Student",
  "school": "ABC-10",
  "studentGrade": "9th Grade",
  "gender": "Male",
  "createdOn": "2026-01-15T10:49:07.947Z",
  "utm_source": "",
  "signUpRef": "cart_page"
}
```

## 4. Differences by Account Type

| Account Type | Extra Fields Required | Can Exist Without memberId | Update-on-Signup |
| :----------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------- |
| Student      | school, grade, gender | Yes                        | Yes              |
| Parent       | phone                 | Yes                        | Yes              |
| Coach        | None                  | No                         | No               |

## 5. Key Notes

- Webflow acts as the **source of truth for CMS items**
- MemberStack is linked to post-Webflow item creation
- MongoDB supports **partial pre-existing records** that are completed during signup
- `familyId` enables grouping of parent–student relationships

---

This flow ensures consistent data synchronization across Webflow, Memberstack, and MongoDB while supporting flexible signup entry points (direct signup, cart-based signup, and admin-created records).
