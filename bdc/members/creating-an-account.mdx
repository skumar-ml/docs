title: "Creating an Account"
---

## How-To

1. Navigate to the sign-up page.
2. Fill in required fields (and provide a <u>valid email address</u>) **TODO: Explain what a valid email address is**
5. Create a password & submit the form to create your account.

<Info>
  Valid Email Address: A valid email address has the format **local-part@domain**, where the local part contains allowed characters (letters, numbers, dots, etc.) and the domain is a real domain with a valid extension (like `.com`). It must follow standard syntax rules and be capable of receiving emails.
</Info>

The platform supports multiple account types to ensure proper role-based access and family linking.

### Parent Accounts

**Required Fields:** First & Last Name, Email Address

### Student Accounts

**Required Fields:** First & Last Name, Parent Name &  Email Address

**Note:** The parent email address is used to link the student account to a parent account via the `familyId`.

### Coach Accounts

**Required Fields:** First & Last Name, Email Address

<Warning>
  There is no way for an admin to create an account for a user. This is contemplated future functionality. If such a need arises, let the tech team know, and we can manually do this

## Technical Steps Involved in Account Creation

### 1: Memberstack

The account creation flow **starts inside Memberstack**. After the user submits the **Sign Up** form (via the Webflow UI), Memberstack creates the user record in **Memberstack’s internal database**. On sign-up, Memberstack triggers Step 2.

### 2: `POST /camp/createUserSignup `

Entry-point API to initiate account signup and synchronize data between Webflow & Memberstack.

**Responsibilities:**

- Accepts signup payload: `name`, `email`, `accountType` (student | parent | coach), `signUpRef. For more details please have a look at the API reference`[link](https://developers.memberstack.com/admin-rest-api/member-actions#create-member) **TODO Can you confirm this payload is passed by Memberstack via the webhook? - YES**
  - TODO: Eventually, we'll just point to the OpenAPI reference for input payload signature... **Added Link**
- **Webflow Insertion:** Formats the payload into Webflow's CMS-compatible structure. Inserts into Webflow CMS's **Member** collection and publishes the CMS item.
- **Webflow ↔ Memberstack linkage:** Receives `itemId` from Webflow in the response. Finds member in Memberstack via the payload's `memberId`.  Updates Memberstack record with `webflow-member-id = itemId` .
- Invokes `createAccount` service to persist data into MongoDB, with different arguments passed depending on if sign-up was from `student` or `parent`.
- After data source sync, the signup flow performs **CRM lead synchronization, referral state updates, and automated email**.

  **CRM Lead Creation / Update**
  - Once `createAccount` succeeds, the API receives the created `student_id` and `parent_id`.
  - The system invokes the internal CRM endpoint: POST /api/v1/external/create-lead
  - A lead is created or updated in the CRM with:`parent_id` (always present),`student_id` (only if a student account was created),`tag_name = "account created"`, `ref_id = memberId` (Memberstack memberId for traceability)
- **Referral Status Update**
  - The system checks the `referral_details` collection using the created parent’s MongoDB `_id` as `guestId`.
  - If a referral record exists, the referral stage is updated: `referred_stage = "Signed_Up"`
    - `updated_on` timestamp is set
- This marks the referral lifecycle transition from **invited / referred → signed up**.
- Purchase-based referral progression is handled later during payment completion (not at signup).
- **Invitation / Account-Exists Emails**
  - When a signup email matches an existing invited user or a pre-existing account, SES is triggered via: `sendEmail.SendEmail.send_to_email(...)`
  - This occurs inside helper flows such as `setFamilyId()` when:
    - A user was previously invited
    - The system links the new signup to an existing family
  - Email templates are fetched from the `email_content` collection and sent via SES.

</Note>

### 1.2 `POST /camp/createAccount`

Creates or updates the user account record in MongoDB, based on if `student` or `parent` data was passed in.

**Responsibilities:**

- If **student or parent records already exist** without a `memberId`:
  - Updates the existing record with: `memberId`, `itemId`, `name`, `email`
- Else, creates a new record for the student or parent.
  - If record is a `student`, then link to the `parent` record (which is also created, if does not exist)
  - `familyId` is updated as [described in this section](https://dca.mintlify.app/bdc/members/overview#family-architecture)

## 2. MongoDB Account Schema

TODO: For SK to review after above is finalized.

### 2.1 Account Document (Common Structure)

```
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "name": "Full Name",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "itemId": "webflow_item_id",
  "familyId": "family_identifier",
  "accountType": "student | parent | coach",
  "memberId": "memberstack_member_id",
  "firstName": "First",
  "lastName": "Last",
  "createdOn": ISODate,
  "updatedOn": ISODate,
  "utm_source": "",
  "signUpRef": ""
}
```

### 2.2 Student Account Example

```
{
  "name": "Diksha Singh",
  "email": "diksha.singh@techment.com",
  "itemId": "",
  "familyId": "r8tt097r1D58i1ti",
  "accountType": "student",
  "memberId": "",
  "firstName": "Diksha",
  "lastName": "Singh",
  "school": "ABC-10",
  "studentGrade": "6th Grade",
  "gender": "Female",
  "dob": "",
  "createdOn": "2026-01-14T06:51:34.477Z",
  "updatedOn": "2026-01-14T07:18:33.222Z",
  "utm_source": "",
  "signUpRef": ""
}
```

---

### 2.3 Student Account (Signup from Cart)

```
{
  "name": "Rahul Student",
  "email": "rahul.student@techment.com",
  "itemId": "",
  "familyId": "",
  "accountType": "student",
  "memberId": "",
  "firstName": "Rahul",
  "lastName": "Student",
  "school": "ABC-10",
  "studentGrade": "9th Grade",
  "gender": "Male",
  "createdOn": "2026-01-15T10:49:07.947Z",
  "utm_source": "",
  "signUpRef": "cart_page"
}
```

## 3. Differences by Account Type

| Account Type | Extra Fields Required | Can Exist Without memberId | Update-on-Signup |
| :----------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------- |
| Student      | school, grade, gender | Yes                        | Yes              |
| Parent       | phone                 | Yes                        | Yes              |
| Coach        | None                  | No                         | No               |

## 5. Key Notes

- Webflow acts as the **source of truth for CMS items**
- MemberStack is linked to post-Webflow item creation
- MongoDB supports **partial pre-existing records** that are completed during signup
- `familyId` enables grouping of parent–student relationships

---

This flow ensures consistent data synchronization across Webflow, Memberstack, and MongoDB while supporting flexible signup entry points (direct signup, cart-based signup, and admin-created records).
