## Signing up or Logging in

Users can create fresh accounts on our [sign-up page](https://www.bergendebate.com/sign-up); users with existing accounts can log-in on our [log-in page](https://www.bergendebate.com/log-in). Accounts are uniquely associated with an email address.

Users that have forgotten their password can do a password reset on the log-in page.

<Warning>
  We do not have an email confirmation process. This has historically led to typos. Adding this functionality is future work, as well as Google OAuth.
</Warning>

## Account Types

The most important distinction between accounts is the `accountType`, which can be `parent`,  `student`, or `coach`. These distinctions control the following:

- Only `parent` accounts can register for BDC classes. A `student` or `coach` account will be asked to log out and sign-in to a `parent` account during the checkout process.
- Only `coach` accounts can access the BDC Coach Portal, which (upon verification) allows them to access functionality like class & trial class attendance and the millions.
- `student` and `parent` accounts see the same portal.

There currently does not exist any mechanism for the admin or user to change the `accountType`. If a need arises, please inform the tech team, and we'll do it manually.

<Note>
  TODO: Can we confirm

  - what happens to coach accounts trying to register for an account?
  - Can students or coach's register via the portal? It doesn't matter as much here, since we have the parent info, but want to confirm if we've handled this case or not...

## Technical Details

### Memberstack

Memberstack handles all of the member logic. This includes things like sign-in auth, password encryption, log-in redirects, gated content, member-specific pages, etc. We are currently on Memberstack V1; our account can be accessed via https://app.memberstack.io/login.

### Family Architecture

Parent and student accounts are connected through a unique `familyId` that links family members together. This architecture supports multiple students under a single parent account and handles various sign-up scenarios.

#### Sign-up flows

**Case 1: New parent sign-up**
1. Parent signs up for a new account
2. Parent registers for classes for a student
3. System assigns a unique `familyId` to both the parent and the student

**Case 2: Existing parent adds new student**
1. Parent (already signed up) registers classes for a new student
2. System assigns the parent's existing `familyId` to the new student

**Case 3: Student sign-up with existing parent**
1. Student signs up using their parent's email address
2. Student is already registered for a class
3. System assigns the parent's `familyId` to the student account

**Case 4: Student sign-up before parent**
1. New student signs up with parent's email
2. Student attempts to register for a class
3. System displays an error message instructing them to log in or sign up with a parent account
4. Parent signs up for an account
5. Parent registers for classes for the student
6. System assigns a unique `familyId` to both the parent and the already signed-up student
