2. **Admin validating coach via Retool**

   The **Verify Coach** section allows admins to review and validate coach accounts before granting full access. Admins can search for a coach using the **Name** or **Email** filters.

   All coach records are displayed in a table.
   - **Unverified coaches** are highlighted and indicate accounts that still need admin approval.
   - **Verified coaches** are clearly marked, confirming they are approved to access the coach portal.

   Admins can update a coach’s status from **Unverified** to **Verified** after reviewing their details. This process ensures only approved and authenticated coaches are active on the platform.
