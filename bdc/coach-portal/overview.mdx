2. **Admin validating coach via Retool**

   The **Verify Coach** section allows admins to review and validate coach accounts before granting full access. Admins can search for a coach using the **Name** or **Email** filters.

   All coach records are displayed in a table.
   - **Unverified coaches are highlighted in pink**, indicating they are pending approval.\
     **Verified coaches are highlighted in green**, indicating they are approved and have full access to the coach portal.
