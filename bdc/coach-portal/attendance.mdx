## Non-Technical

TODO: What coaches see for attendance. How they can use.

The [Attendance ](https://www.bergendebate.com/portal/attendance)page allows coaches to manage and track student attendance for their assigned classes. Coaches can select a specific class from the dropdown at the top. Using the status filter and search field, they can quickly find a student or view students who are checked in or not checked in.

The student list shows all enrolled students for the selected class. Coaches can **mark attendance** by checking students in during the session. This helps ensure accurate attendance records for each class.

## Admins (Retool)

TODO: How attendance works on Retool for admins.

Admins use the Attendance section in [this ](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/db048042-b646-11f0-bec3-53e0a4d2f887/Student%20Consolidation/Attendance%20Dashboard%20-%20SC)Retool page to view and track student attendance across all classes and sessions. At the top, admins can filter data by year, session, level, day, location, or student name to narrow down the required class or student.

On the left side, the **Class Details** panel shows all available classes for the selected filters. Selecting a class displays its enrolled students on the right.

The main table shows each student’s attendance week by week. A **check mark (✓)** indicates the student attended that week, while a **cross (✕)** indicates absence. This gives admins a clear, consolidated view of attendance history across multiple weeks and classes, helping with monitoring, and reporting.

## Technical

TODO: Explain in detail how this works (APIs, JS files/methods needed to render). Both for Retool + Portal
