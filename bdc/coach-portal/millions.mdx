## Non-Technical

TODO: What coaches see for millions. How they can use

In the Millions section, coaches can view a list of students along with their email IDs and current Millions balance. A search option is available to quickly find a student by name.

Coaches can **reward students** by clicking the **“+” (plus)** icon. This opens a popup where the coach enters the amount to add and an optional description, then saves it.

Coaches can **deduct Millions** by clicking the **“–” (minus)** icon. This opens a similar popup to enter the amount to remove with an optional reason.\
This feature helps coaches track, add, or deduct Millions based on student performance, participation, or behavior in class.

## Technical

TODO: Explain in detail how this works (APIs, JS files/methods needed to render). Remember, keep this restricted to Webflow (we've already discussed Retool in the Customer Portal)
