Let's come to this at the end. It'll be easier to write this once we've written out the general Trial Classes docs...

### Overview

Coaches can view attendance for trial classes after logging in with their coach account. Once logged in, they navigate to the **Free Trial Class** section from the dashboard.

The [page](https://www.bergendebate.com/portal/free-trial-class-details) displays a list of trial classes on the left. Selecting a class shows the enrolled students on the right with **attendance status already marked or unmarked by the admin**. They can also **add notes** for individual students using the **Add Notes** button to record observations or feedback.
