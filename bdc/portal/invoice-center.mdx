## **Invoice Center**

The [Invoice Center](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/4cb7af14-b658-11f0-b7e1-0f98c055d69f/Student%20Consolidation/Invoice%20Center%20With%20Zero%20Amount%20-SC) page allows admins to **generate and manage invoices** for students for a selected session and year. Admins first filter and select students, then choose how the payment will be collected.

### Payment Methods Overview

**JotForm**\
Used when payment needs to be collected via an external JotForm link. The admin adds the JotForm URL and sends it to parents to complete the payment outside the platform.

**Stripe**\
Used for direct online payments. The admin sets the payable amount for card and/or bank transfer, which parents can pay securely through Stripe.

**Bucket**\
Used when the invoice amount is adjusted using internal credits or predefined pricing options, without requiring an immediate online checkout.

**Bucket Invoice Setup**

- Admin can apply **returner, sibling, or early-bird** options if applicable.
- Different amounts can be set for **card vs bank transfer**.
- If an invoice already exists, it can be **edited instead of recreated**.

## **Manage Invoice**

The [Manage Invoice](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/8f8c2b60-6f39-11ef-81be-bf44285ea2ae/2024%20phase%202/Manage%20Invoice%20Q2-24) page lets admins view and manage all invoices in one place.\
Admins can search and filter invoices, check their processing status, and quickly **view, edit, or delete** invoices as needed.
