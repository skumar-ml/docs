## **Invoice Center**

The [Invoice Center](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/4cb7af14-b658-11f0-b7e1-0f98c055d69f/Student%20Consolidation/Invoice%20Center%20With%20Zero%20Amount%20-SC) page allows admins to **generate and manage invoices** for students for a selected session and year. Admins first filter and select students, then choose how the payment will be collected.

### **Managing Selected Students**

Selected students on the **Add Student List** are added to the **Current Student List** on the right, where admins can review them and remove any student if needed before proceeding.

### Payment Methods Overview

![Image](/images/image-79.png)

**JotForm**\
Used when payment needs to be collected via an external JotForm link. The admin adds the JotForm URL and sends it to parents to complete the payment outside the platform.

**Stripe**\
Used for direct online payments. The admin sets the payable amount for card and/or bank transfer, which parents can pay securely through Stripe.

**Bucket**\
Used when the invoice amount is adjusted using internal credits or predefined pricing options, without requiring an immediate online checkout.

**Bucket Invoice Setup**

- Admin can apply **returner, sibling, or early-bird** options if applicable.
- Different amounts can be set for **card vs bank transfer**.
- If an invoice already exists, it can be **edited instead of recreated**.

## **Manage Invoice**

The [Manage Invoice](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/8f8c2b60-6f39-11ef-81be-bf44285ea2ae/2024%20phase%202/Manage%20Invoice%20Q2-24) page lets admins view and manage all invoices in one place.\
Admins can search and filter invoices, check their processing status, and quickly **view, edit, or delete** invoices as needed.

### Key Columns Explained

- **Prev Student (Self Reported)**\
  Indicates whether the parent marked the student as a returning student during registration.
- **Prev Student (Database)**\
  Shows whether the system already recognizes the student as a returning student based on existing records.
- **Pre-Registrant**\
  Indicates if the student was pre-registered before the invoice was generated, which may affect pricing or discounts.
- **Supplementary Program**\
  Shows whether any additional (upsell) programs are attached to the student’s invoice.

<Note>
  TODO: I think this needs some explanation on how to interpret the different columns (pre-register and bundle). \
  \
  I also think we need some explanation of how to assign bucket invoices vs. other types of invoices.
</Note>

### Actions Column

- **Add Bucket**

  <Columns cols={2}>
    <Card title="Purpose" icon="sparkles">
      Used to assign an existing predefined (bucket-based) invoice when an invoice was not auto-generated or needs to be manually linked to a student.
    </Card>
    <Card title="View" icon="sparkles">
      ![Add Bucket](/images/add-bucket.png)
    </Card>
  </Columns>
- **View Family**\
  Navigates to the [family details](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/e5b38f92-b63c-11f0-af15-3348c57919db/Student%20Consolidation/Family%20Snapshot%20-%20SC?familyId=&urlPaymentId=) page, where admins can view all linked students, registrations, invoices, and payment history for the selected family.
- **Refund**\
  Redirects to a [refund flow](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/634efaf0-b646-11f0-90e3-df4825553f35/Student%20Consolidation/Student%20Registration%20Details%20-%20SpeedUp%20-%20SC?paymentId=691efb543180f1fe2f21408d), where admins can review invoice/payment details and initiate a refund if applicable.

### Bucket Invoice vs Other Invoices

- **Bucket invoices** are manually assigned using **Add Bucket** and are generally used for structured or predefined pricing scenarios.
- Other invoices may be auto-generated during registration or checkout based on selected programs and discounts.

## Invoice Rates

The [Invoice Rates](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/0ac16b4a-ff24-11ef-b99e-67da19340c58/2025%20Phase%20B/Invoice%20Rates%20-%20V2) page allows admins to **define and manage invoice pricing rules (buckets)** for different years and sessions.

![Image](/images/image-85.png)

Admins can view existing **base pricing, fees, discounts, and deposit amounts**, and see how different combinations (returner, sibling, early bird) affect the final invoice amount.

**Create Bucket Popup**

Using **Create Bucket**, admins can set up a new pricing bucket for a selected year and session. If a bucket already exists, the system prevents duplication and prompts the admin to edit instead.

**Edit Bucket Popup**

Using Edit Bucket, admins can update existing pricing values. Any changes apply to future invoices generated for the selected year and session.

<Note>
  TODO: Yogesh, I think we need some technical explanation for everything that happens when an admin sends out an invoice. Specifically, there are a lot of database collections for invoices, so can you explain in which ones records are created (or updated)?

  Either that explanation can happen here, or you can try to give it in the Database section of the "Invoices" page.
