## **Invoice Center**

### Payment Methods Overview

**JotForm**\
Used when payment needs to be collected via an external JotForm link. The admin adds the JotForm URL and sends it to parents to complete the payment outside the platform.

**Stripe**\
Used for direct online payments. The admin sets the payable amount for card and/or bank transfer, which parents can pay securely through Stripe.

**Bucket**\
Used when the invoice amount is adjusted using internal credits or predefined pricing options, without requiring an immediate online checkout.

**Bucket Invoice Setup**

- Admin can apply **returner, sibling, or early-bird** options if applicable.
- Different amounts can be set for **card vs bank transfer**.
- If an invoice already exists, it can be **edited instead of recreated**.
