### **Invoice Center**

The [Invoice Center](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/4cb7af14-b658-11f0-b7e1-0f98c055d69f/Student%20Consolidation/Invoice%20Center%20With%20Zero%20Amount%20-SC) page allows admins to **generate and manage invoices** for students for a selected session and year. Admins first filter and select students, then choose how the payment will be collected.

**Payment Methods**

- **JotForm**: Used when payment needs to be collected via an external JotForm link. Admin adds the form URL and sends it to parents.
- **Stripe**: Used for direct online payments. Admin sets card and/or bank transfer amounts that parents can pay through Stripe.
- **Bucket**: Used when the invoice amount is adjusted using internal credits or predefined amounts (no immediate online checkout).

**Invoice Setup**

- Admin can apply **returner, sibling, or early-bird** options if applicable.
- Different amounts can be set for **card vs bank transfer**.
- If an invoice already exists, it can be **edited instead of recreated**.
