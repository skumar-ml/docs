## Non-Technical

The [Payment History](#) page allows parents to view students, track outstanding invoices, and complete pending payments.

### **How to Use**

- **Select a Student**\
  At the top of the page, all linked students are displayed. Click on a student to view their payment details.
- **View Outstanding Invoices**\
  Once a student is selected, all **pending or unpaid invoices** for that student appear below.

  Click on **Invoice Breakdown** to see a detailed view of the charges, including tuition, discounts, deposits paid, and the remaining balance.

- **Make a Payment**\
  Choose a payment method (Credit/Debit Card or Bank Transfer) next to the invoice to proceed with payment via Stripe.
- **Track Payment Status**\
  After payment, the invoice status updates automatically. Once cleared, the **Outstanding Invoices** section shows **“No Invoices.”**
- **Completed Enrollments (usable for tax purposes)**

  After successful payment (or zero-amount enrollment), the record moves to **Completed Enrollments**.

  This section provides:
  - A historical view of completed enrollments by year
  - Downloadable **PDF receipts** for each enrollment

### Dashboard

The main portal Dashboard uses `getPortalDetail` and shows invoices in an accordion for each student tab.

##### **Invoice display + paying the invoice**

1. **JS — init and request**
   - Portal (`portal_new_ui.js`) loads with `apiBaseURL` and `memberId`. Calls `getPortalDetail`.
2. **API**
   - `getPortalDetail` returns per-student data with `currentSession`, `futureSession`, and `pastSession`. Each session has an `invoiceList` (and `breakDownList` per invoice). Invoice data comes from `invoice_notifications` joined with `invoice_records`, `invoice_payment_link`, `invoice_responses`, and `stripe_checkout_customer`.
   - **Returns data (invoice-specific)**

     **Student data object** (per student):

3. **JS — after response**

   - Show the invoice accordion: for each invoice show name, “Invoice Breakdown” link, and Pay buttons (Bank Transfer, Credit/Debit Card) for unpaid ones. Show “Needs to be completed” or “All Paid” and “X of Y invoices complete”.
   - When the user clicks Pay (Bank Transfer, Credit/Debit Card) , call `createCheckoutUrl` and redirect to Stripe.

##### **Itemized Invoice breakdown**

- **Breakdown** for each invoice is computed from `invoice_rates` (by year and session). Line items include: Semester Tuition, New Student Fee (if not returner), Sibling Discount, Early Bird discount, Deposit.
- **Breakdown modal:** When the user clicks “Invoice Breakdown”, a modal opens with the line items and remaining balance. Itemized PDFs use the same breakdown data plus `invoice_responses` after payment.

### Payment History Page

##### **Rendering**

1. **JS — init and request**
   - Payment History page (`payment_history.js`, class `PaymentHistory`) loads with `apiBaseURL` and `memberId`. Calls `getPortalDetail`.
2. **API**
   - `getPortalDetail` (described in detail above) returns the same per-student data (`currentSession`, `futureSession`, `pastSession`; each session has `invoiceList` and `breakDownList`).
3. **JS — after response**
   - If there is no data: show a “no records” message and stop.
   - If there is data: build one tab per student. Fill each tab with **Outstanding invoices** (invoices not completed; user can pay from here) and **Payment history** (completed enrollments from current and past sessions, by year; user can download an itemized PDF per session via `generateItemizedInvoice`).

**Itemized Invoice PDF**

<Note>
  TODO: Can you explain at a high-level what information is needed for `generateItemizedInvoice`.  Especially, can you explain this line from above: " Itemized PDFs use the same breakdown data plus `invoice_responses` after payment."
</Note>

##### **Portal sidebar display**

- **When there is portal data:** The page shows student tabs, Outstanding Invoices, and Completed Enrollments; the first student is selected by default.
- **When there is no data:** The page shows a “no records” message and hides the main content.
- **Sidebar:**  Whether the Payment History link is visible in the portal sidebar, at least 1 purchased program is available
