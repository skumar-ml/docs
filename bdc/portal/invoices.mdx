## Non-Technical

TODO: What users get to see & how they can use Invoices page. 

## Admins (Retool)

TODO: How can admin manage this on Retool. This section will probably be a little long, since we have a lot of invoice functionality. Explain bucket system, and how we handle pre-reg / bundled people.

## Technical

TODO: Explain in detail how the invoice system works (from Retool to rendering here). Include DB collections and relations. Explain itemized invoice logic. Explain invoice breakdowns.
