## Non-Technical

TODO: What users get to see for both returner conversion & pre-registration. I think there's a few different states here, so you can cover all of them

## Admins (Retool)

TODO: How can admin returner conversion on Retool. Pre-Reg management was already discussed (link to doc)

## Technical

TODO: Explain in detail how this works (APIs, JS files/methods needed to render)
