## Non-Technical

### Returner Conversion

Once a student’s next level recommendation is published, the **“Next Recommended Program”** section becomes visible on the portal, showing the next level and semester with **Register Now** and **Learn More** options. If it is not published, this section is not visible.

### Pre-Registration

This section displays the **current pre-registration status** for returning students along with a **countdown timer** indicating when the pre-registration or early-bird offer ends.

### Returner conversion & pre-registration

![Image](/images/image-51.png)

When pre-registration is active **and** the next recommended program is published, users see a pre-registration banner along with the **Next Recommended Program** section. The banner highlights that registration is open and shows a countdown, while the recommended program displays the next level and term with **Register Now** and **Learn More** options.

Clicking **Register Now** takes the user directly to the Stripe payment page. Clicking **Learn More** opens the Next Recommended Program popup with program details.

<Note>
  TODO: This sentence must be inaccurate "Clicking **Register Now** takes the user directly to the Stripe payment page".

  The user is taken to class location & time selection.

  Please ensure you are checking for accuracy.
</Note>

### After the Pre-Registration Period

Once pre-registration ends, the banner updates to reflect the new registration state and the countdown is removed. The **Next Recommended Program** section continues to be shown if it is published, and users proceed through the standard registration flow based on availability.

## Admins (Retool)

TODO: How can admin returner conversion on Retool. Pre-Reg management was already discussed (link to doc)

### Manage Returner Conversion

The [Returner Conversion](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/385a97e8-695f-11f0-94e7-d3db21f5beef/Q2%6025/Manage%20Recommended%20Level) page helps admins manage recommendations for **returning students**, meaning students who have previously enrolled and are eligible to continue to the next level.\
Admins can review and update the recommended next level , grade etc., apply filters to find specific students, and publish or unpublish recommendations to control what appears on the user portal.

<Tip>
  **Publishing** the recommended level means that the user sees it on their portal. This should **only be done after the launch** of the registration cycle (or pre-registration).
</Tip>

### **Pre-Reg Management**

**For pre-registration management, please refer **[**to this document**](/bdc/checkout-systems/semester/pre-reg-system)**.**

## Technical

### **Database**

Returner conversion and pre-registration use data from **getPortalDetails**: **recommendedLevel** (from the recommendation program / class_level, when published) and **futureSession** (from payment/upsell data). The API returns these shapes per student.

<Note>
  TODO: We should be starting with the database. I think the above text ^^ can be deleted
</Note>

**recommendedLevel** (returned when the student's recommendation has `publish == True` for the current session):

<Note>
  TODO: I think this is explained poorly. We need to explain how returner conversion is managed in the payment_details collection (and explain the fields). \

  Please re-write this section as you've done for other pages.

### **Flow**

1. **JS (Portal)** — init and request
   - File: `portal_new_ui.js`; class: `Portal`, which fetches `getPortalDetails` once.
2. **API (getPortalDetails/)**
   - Returns all student records for the family, including current recommendation program data. For each student in the family and the **current** session, if the student's recommendation has `publish == True`, the API returns `recommendedLevel` (see table above). Also returns `futureSession` per student (from payment/upsell data; see table above). Used for pre-reg timing and "has bundle" logic.
3. **JS (Portal)** — after response

   <Note>
     TODO: I think we should split this page based on the different conditions. It's kind of confusing right now, since all the conditions are mixed. 
   </Note>
   - **Visibility:** Whether the user sees anything in this area depends on (1) the API returned a `recommendedLevel` for that student (backend only sends it when the recommendation is published), and (2) whether the student has a future-session **bundle** (from upsell: a future session with **no classId**).
   - **Time windows:** The code checks the current date against two time windows:
     - **Pre-registration window** (from **futureSession**): between `pre-registrationDates.preRegStartDate` and `programDates.startDate`. When the user is in this window and has a bundle, the pre-reg block is shown (e.g. "Register Now" only).
     - **Registration window** (from **recommendedLevel**): between `pre-registrationDates.preRegStartDate` and `registrationEndDate`. When the user is in this window and has a published recommendation, the "Next Recommended Program" line and both "Register Now" and "Learn More" can show.
   - **Buttons:** During pre-reg only (bundle + in pre-reg window): **Register Now** only. During registration (published recommendation + in registration window): both **Register Now** and **Learn More**. If both pre-reg and registration are active, both buttons can show; otherwise both are hidden and the section is hidden.
   - **Register Now:** Clicking **Register Now** goes to a URL set from **recommendedLevel** and the current registration window. When returner conversion is active and today is within the registration window: link is `https://www.bergendebate.com/programs/{levelUrl}` (e.g. `programs/level-3b` for Level 3B); user is sent to that program/level page in a new tab. Otherwise: link is `https://www.bergendebate.com/classes-overview`; user is sent to the classes overview in a new tab.
   - **Learn More:** Clicking **Learn More** opens the Next Recommended Program modal. The modal shows: title "Next Step for [student name]"; recommended line "Recommended: [session year | level]"; early-bird countdown if **recommendedLevel** has `earlyBirdDeadlineDate`; an Enroll Now button (same link logic as Register Now); and "Why This Program" copy. Closing the modal (backdrop or close control) hides it; the modal does not navigate the page.
