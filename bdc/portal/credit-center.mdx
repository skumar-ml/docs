TODO: Shubham, provide some overview of BDC credits here

## Non-Technical

### Overview

The [Credit Center](https://www.bergendebate.com/portal/credit-balance) web page shows the user how much credit they currently have and how it has been used over time.

- **Credit Balance** at the top displays the total available credit amount that can be applied toward payments.
- Below that, users see common questions like:
  - _How do I get credit?_
  - _How is credit applied?_\
    These sections help users understand credit usage without contacting support.
- The **Credit Transaction History** section lists all credit activity in a table:
  - **Type** – indicates whether the credit was added (**Credit**) or deducted (**Debit**).
  - **Amount** – the credit value added or deducted

## Admins (Retool)

The [Credit Center](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/2cdaaa88-6f1f-11ef-b711-f7b5e1b8821c/2024%20phase%202/Credit%20Center) retool page allows admins to **add monetary credits to parent accounts** in a controlled and organized way.

#### 1. Filter the Context

At the top, the admin selects:

**Class** (e.g., Level 2A), **Location, Session** (e.g., Winter/Spring), **Year, Parent** (optional)

These filters ensure credits are applied to the **correct class, session, and families**.

#### 2. Select Parents

Under **Select Parents**, admins can choose who will receive credits:

**Click Upload Email** , **Upload Name  and Add All** – selects all parents matching the filters

Selected parents move to the **Selected Parents** panel for review.

#### 3. Review Parent Credit Status

The left Parent table shows all basic parent details  **where Add (+) action is used ** to select individual parents..

This helps admins verify existing balances before adding new credits.

#### 4. Add Credits

In the **Add Credits** section:

- Admin enters the **Credit Amount (\$)**
- Adds a **Description** (reason for the credit)

Clicking **Send** applies the credit to all selected parents.
