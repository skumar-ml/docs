## Technical

TODO: Explain (at a high-level) the tech. What JS and APIs get called. Don't get into too much detail, since there are a lot of components on the dashboard. Things to talk about:

1. Aggregating info by student
2. Showing current class view
   1. Screenshot
   2. Calendar + resources, Announcements, Invoices & Forms, Millions, etc
1. Future + Past Classes
2. Anything else I missed
