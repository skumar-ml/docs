## Non-Technical

TODO: What users get to see & how they can use Referrals. What happens to users that get referred (explain pop-up that they see via referral link..)

### Overview

The [Referral](https://www.bergendebate.com/portal/referral) page allows users to invite friends and track their referral rewards in a simple and transparent way.

### Refer a Friend

Users can invite friends by entering their **name and email address**.\
Each invitation contains a **unique referral link or code** that friends can use during signup to ensure rewards are applied correctly.

### Progress Tracker

A visual progress tracker shows how many people the user has successfully referred and the **rewards unlocked at each milestone**.

As referrals increase, users can clearly see:

- Referral count achieved
- Reward credits earned
- Upcoming reward milestones

This helps users stay motivated and understand how close they are to the next reward.

### My Referrals

The **My Referrals** section displays a list of all invited friends along with:

- Friend’s name, Current referral status (Pending, Signed Up, Enrolled), Date referred, Enrollment status

Users can easily track which referrals are completed and which are still pending.

### Referral FAQ

A FAQ section answers common questions such as:

- What the referral program is
- Who can be referred
- What rewards both the user and their friend receive

This section helps users quickly understand the referral process without needing external support.

## Admins (Retool)

This [referral](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/bfafe442-3222-11f0-aebe-07c9e7fd34a5/2025%20Phase%20B/Referrals/referrals) page is an **internal admin panel built ** to manage and monitor referral activity.

### Top Filters & Actions

- At the top, admins can select a referrer, view the linked coupon code, choose a referred user, or click **Add Referrals** to manually add a new referral via a popup.

  **Add Referral Popup**
- Fill in referrer details (family/referrer, parent name, parent email).\
  All required fields are validated, and on **Save**, the referral is instantly added to the list.

Admins can scroll through the list to quickly review all referral details.

### Referral Details (Right Panel)

This section shows detailed information for the selected referrer, helping admins track and verify referrals.

- Displays the referred user’s details, referral date, purchase/enrollment date, and current status (Purchased / Not Purchased).
- **View Family** opens the [Family Snapshot ](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/e5b38f92-b63c-11f0-af15-3348c57919db/Student%20Consolidation/Family%20Snapshot%20-%20SC)page, where admins can see parent details, students, registrations, and overall family information.
- **Mark as Purchased / Mark as Unpurchased** opens a confirmation popup.

  - This allows admins to manually update the referral status if needed.
  - The popup asks for confirmation before applying the change to avoid mistakes.

## Technical

TODO: Explain in detail how referral system works (from Retool updates to rendering here). Include DB collections and relations. Do not explain how purchase or sign-up gets changed in status, or how new coupon code gets created (just link to respective docs). Also, explain what a referred user sees when they click a referral link.
