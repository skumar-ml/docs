## Non-Technical

### Overview

The [Referral](https://www.bergendebate.com/portal/referral) page allows users to invite friends and track their referral rewards in a simple and transparent way.

**Refer a Friend:** Users can invite friends by entering their **name and email address**. Each invitation contains a **unique referral link or a coupon code** that friends can use during signup to ensure rewards are applied correctly.

<Note>
  TODO: I think we need to explain the invitation flow a little better for non-technicals -- what happens (across the tech stack) when user is invited... What gets sent in email? What happens if a new user reaches website via link...
</Note>

**Progress Tracker: **A visual progress tracker shows how many people the user has successfully referred and the **rewards unlocked at each milestone**.

**My Referrals:** displays a list of all invited friends along with.. 

<Note>
  TODO: 

  1. Screnshot


  2. Explain when a user gets added here (if form was submitted, but what about via invited link..., obviously, if coupon code is used at checkout)?
</Note>

## Admins (Retool)

The [referral](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/bfafe442-3222-11f0-aebe-07c9e7fd34a5/2025%20Phase%20B/Referrals/referrals) Retool page is used to manage and monitor referral activity. On the left, admins can view how many referrals each family has. Clicking a record shows (on the left) detailed information for the selected referrer. The admin can manually mark an invited user as purchased.

TODO: Add a screenshot of the overall page...

Admins can also manually **Add a Referral. **TODO: What happens if user is already purchased, does it auto-attribute?

## Technical

### Overview

The referral system lets a **referrer**  share a **referral link** and **coupon code** and submit referred people’s **name** and **email** via \*\*POST \*\*`addReferralData` (referral-promotion-service). The API creates a `referral_details` record, sends an email to the referred person with the coupon code, and schedules follow-up emails. The **referrals page** (portal) fetches \*\*GET \*\*`getReferralData` to show the referrer’s `coupon_code`, `referrals` list (`name`, `email`, `date_referred`, `purchased_date`, `referred_stage`), and a form to add new referrals.

**Referral link visibility** in the portal sidebar is controlled by `checkReferralsAccess` (only if the member has at least one `currentSession`).

When a **referred user** lands on the site via the referral link (**?code=...&id=...**), `referrals_modal.js` shows a **pop-up** with the discount code, referrer name, and a form to claim the discount (name/email → `addReferralData`). How `referred_stage` is set to **Signed_Up** or **Purchased**, and how `coupon_details` are created, is not covered here; see the [checkout](/bdc/checkout-systems) and [post-payment](/bdc/checkout-systems/semester/web-checkout/technical/post-payment) docs.

### API and data source (referrer)

- \*\*GET \*\*`getReferralData` (referral-promotion-service)
  - Look up member's `familyId`. If member has no `familyId` (or empty/null), return .
  - Get's `coupon_code` and `couponId`. If no coupon, return `{}`.
  - Look up who this family has referred in `referral_details`. For each referral, gather `name`, `email`, `date_referred`, `purchased_date`, `referred_stage`.
  - Response: `{ referrals (array), coupon_code }`.
- \*\*POST \*\*`addReferralData` (referral-promotion-service)

  This API handles the referral flow **when a parent refers someone by email**. It first checks whether the referred person already exists or was already referred.\
  If the person is new, it creates a guest parent account automatically.\
  The referral is then linked to the referrer’s family and an available coupon is assigned.\
  A referral email with the coupon code is sent immediately to the guest.\
  Follow-up reminder emails are scheduled automatically, and the referral is tracked in the CRM.

<Note>
  TODO: make the `addReferralData` more technical (reference collections, fields, etc).
</Note>

### DB collections and relations

| Collection           | Role                                                                                           | Key fields                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **referral_details** | One document per referred person; links referrer (`memberId`/`familyId`) to guest (`guestId`). | `memberId`, `referral_familyId`, `guestId`, `date_referred`, `purchased_date`, `referred_stage` ("None" / "Signed_Up" / "Purchased"), `couponId`, `email_sent` |
| **coupon_details**   | One per family; stores coupon code for referral rewards.                                       | `familyId`, `coupon_code` (and others; creation/lifecycle is in checkout/post-payment docs)                                                                    |

- **Relation:** `getReferralData` joins `referral_details` to `members` (guest) by `guestId` and to `coupon_details` by `couponId` (via referrer’s `familyId`). `referred_stage` is updated to **Signed_Up** when the guest signs up (see sign-up flow) and to **Purchased** when they complete a purchase (see [post-payment](#)).

### Portal rendering (referrals page)

- **JS:** `referrals.js`, `ReferralProgram` class. The page is instantiated with `data` (`memberId`, `baseUrl`, `referralCount`, `maxReferrals`, `rewards`, `icons`).
- **Flow:** **loadReferralData()** → **GET getReferralData/**. If no **coupon_code**, alert and redirect to homepage. Set **#referralCode** to **coupon_code**; set **[data-referral='referral-link-input']** to [**https://www.bergendebate.com?code=\$&id=\$**](https://www.bergendebate.com?code=${btoa\(coupon_code\)}&id=${btoa\(memberId\)}). Copy buttons: **[data-referrals='copy']** (code), **[data-referrals='copy-link']** (link). **referrals** table: **#referralList**; each row has name (from API), status (Enrolled / Pending / Signed Up from **referred_stage**), date_referred, purchased_date. Count of “enrolled” referrals (referred_stage not None/Signed_Up) is shown in **[data-referrals='count']**. **createTracker** / **createMobileTracker** render progress (desktop/mobile) from **maxReferrals**, **rewards**, **icons**. Form **#referralForm** (name, email) → **handleFormSubmit** → **POST addReferralData** with **name**, **email**, **memberId**; on success, hide form, show success, reload **loadReferralData()**. **.no-record-div** shown when no coupon or no referrals.

<Note>
  TODO: Above needs to be updated to be a little more readable
</Note>

- **Sidebar visibility:** **portal_new_ui.js**  calls **checkReferralsAccess(data)** after **setupTabs**. If any student has **currentSession** (length \> 0), **hasCurrentSession** is true; all **[sidebar-menu="referrals"]** elements are set to **display: flex**, else **display: none**. **hasReferralSession** (and memberId) is stored in **localStorage** for use elsewhere.

<Note>
  TODO: Did not review below. I can tell this page is a little more unfinished -- so waiting.
</Note>

### What a referred user sees (referral link)

Checks URL parameters for referral code and ID, displays modal when user arrives via referral link or based on suppression rules, handles form submission to claim referral discount, manages modal suppression for 1 hour after dismissal, and processes referral flow.

The referral modal is triggered when a user lands on the website using a referral link\
(`https://www.bergendebate.com?code=...&id=...`, where both values are base64-encoded).

On page load, the `ReferralModal` class reads the `code` and `id` from the URL. If present, it decodes them, stores referral details in `localStorage`, updates the discount code on the page, and fetches the referrer’s name to display in the modal. If the user has not already submitted their name and email, the referral modal is shown.

When the user submits the form, the details are sent to the `addReferralData` API. On success, the referral is saved, a confirmation message is shown, and the modal closes automatically. If the referral already exists or fails, an error message is displayed.

If the modal is dismissed (close button, background click, or “No thanks”), it is suppressed for 1 hour using `localStorage`. During this time, the modal will not reappear unless the user visits again using a referral link.

If the user returns without referral parameters but has incomplete referral data saved locally, the modal may still appear to complete the process. Otherwise, no modal is shown.
