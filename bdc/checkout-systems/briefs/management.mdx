## Overview

TODO: (for Shubham) -- where people can see briefs & can stand-alone checkout. Difference between full & light

## Retool

### Adding or Editing Briefs

[This Retool page](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/b98e67d2-9528-11f0-a770-eb637de74341/Q3%6025/Manage%20Briefs/page1) allows admins to **view, add, and edit all available briefs** (called in this Retool page as topics) along with their **Full and Light versions** and pricing details.

The **left panel** displays a list of all added topics and the **right panel** shows the **details of the selected topic**, including description, price, PDF URL, and preview PDF URL.

<Note>
  Brief details are shown separately for **Full Version** and **Light Version** using tabs.
</Note>

### Adding a New Topic (Brief)

**To add a new brief**, click **“Add Topic”**, which triggers a pop-up. Enter basic details. Some important fields:

- **Display Order** controls which brief is shown first (or highest) on the website. Lower numbers place higher in the order.
- **URLs:** This field expects a publicly accessible PDF URL. Such URLs can also be generated by hosting a PDF on Webflow (or any public file hosting service) and copying the public CDN URL.

<Tip>
  The Preview URL can be created by copying the Brief PDF into a new version file and only keeping the first 5-10% of pages (to give potential customers a _taste_.
</Tip>

## Technical: Offerings Page

<Note>
  TODO: Katyayani, this is not what I want. I want you to be more technical. Specicfically, focus on what JS files control the dynamic generation, and what APIs get called.

  Anyone can look at the website and see the action buttons and elements in the card, so it's not important to describe in detail. **I think all of the below can be deleted**.
</Note>

### Briefs Listing

The briefs page displays **all available Bergen Briefs** in a card-based layout.

Each brief card includes:

- Short description of the brief content
- Available versions:
  - **Full Version** with pricing
  - **Light Version** with pricing
- Action buttons: **Preview** and **Purchase**

The pricing for both **Light** and **Full** versions is clearly shown on the page to help users compare options before purchasing.
