- Each brief card contains two options:
  - **Full Version**
  - **Light Version**

### 3. Selecting Briefs

- When the user selects **Full** or **Light** for any brief:
  - The selected item is immediately added to the **Order Details** section on the right.

    - Price after credits (if applied)

### 5. Applying Credits

- **If the user clicks “Yes, apply credits”:**
  - Credits are automatically applied to the order, and the modal is closed.
  - The **Processing** button reflects the updated amount on the Stripe payment page.
- **If the user clicks “No, save them”:**
  - The order continues without applying credits, and the user is navigated to the Stripe payment page.

### 6. Stripe Checkout

- After confirming the credits choice:
  - The user is redirected to the **Stripe checkout page**.
