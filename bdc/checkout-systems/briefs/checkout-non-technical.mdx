## Non-Technical

TODO: Explain non-technical process for checkout (stand-alone). This should be pretty simple.

## Briefs Checkout Flow

### 1. Log-in or Sign-up

If the user is not logged in, the user is shown the **account signup form** on the Briefs Checkout page and must complete signup before continuing. This is the same as all of our other checkout flows.

### 2. Brief Selection

Once the user logs in successfully, the user is taken to the **Select Briefs** section. They can select multiple briefs, but must choose between the **Full** and **Light** version.

Any selected item is immediately added to the **Order Details** section on the right, and the **total price** updates dynamically based on selections.

### 3. Payment

On clicking the **Next** button, a **credits popup** is displayed (if the user has Bergen credits available). There, they can opt to apply or save their BDC credits. \<TODO: SK link to where this has been described in detail\>. 

Then, the user is redirected to the **Stripe checkout page** to complete payment.
