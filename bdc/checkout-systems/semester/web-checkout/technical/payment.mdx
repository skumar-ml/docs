title: "Payment"
---

This section explains the available payment options, how Stripe checkout links are created, what happens when users are redirected to Stripe, and how the system restores state when users return from the Stripe payment page.

### Available Payment Methods

The system provides two payment options for class registration:

**1. Bank Transfer (ACH):** This option is selected by default. The base price (no processing fees) is used. Stripe handles the payment, ensuring no bank details are stored by us.

**2. Credit Card:** If selected, a processing fee `(amount + 0.3 / 0.971)` is applied. Standard credit/debit card payment via Stripe.

### Payment Option Selection

Payment options are displayed using a tab-based interface, where users can switch between **Bank Transfer** and **Credit Card**. The selected payment option determines which Stripe checkout URL is generated and updates pricing (in the order details) dynamically.

**Dynamic Pricing**

Dynamic pricing updates are handled entirely on the **frontend**, without additional API calls. We use `onClickListeners()` on  `.payment-cards-tab-link` UI elements. These event listeners are put in place by `updatePriceForCardPayment()` , which is called during **class initialization.**

When the **credit card** payment option is selected, we apply the Stripe card processing fee using the formula: `(amount + 0.30) / 0.971` .

When **bank transfer** is selected, price elements are reset to their original (base price) values.

When **upsells** are added, `updateAmount()` recalculates totals and triggers the active payment tab click to ensure pricing reflect the current payment method.

<Accordion title="The following price displays are updated">
  - Core product deposit: `[data-stripe='totalDepositPrice']`
  - Add-on program prices: `[data-stripe='addon-price']`
  - Add-on deposit prices: `[data-stripe='addon-deposit-price']`
  - Brief prices: `[data-stripe='brief-price']`
  - Gray summary price display: `.current-price-gray`
</Accordion>

### When Payment Options Are Displayed

Payment options appear when:

- A class time slot is selected
- The class has available seats (not waitlisted)
- The user account type is not `student`
- For pre-registrants, payment options appear only when supplementary programs or briefs are selected. Else, the registration is free.

## Checkout Link System

When the user proceeds to payment, the system creates a Stripe checkout session based on the selected payment method.

The User clicking **"Pay Now"**, triggers the `initializeStripePayment()` from the `class_details_stripe_bundle.js` file. This method is the **entry point** for all checkout logic.

### BDC Credit Check

**First, we check if the user has BDC Credits.** If they do, a modal prompts the user to apply available Bergen credits. The selection is saved as `applyCredit` and included in checkout data. This logic is handled by `waitForCreditApplicationChoice(webflowMemberId)` in `utils.js` .

<Accordion title="Logic for BDC Credits">
  1.  Credit balance is checked via `GET getCreditBalance/{webflowMemberId}`
  2. If credit is `0` or invalid → returns `false &` 

     modal is skipped
  3. If credit exists → displays `#bergen-credits-modal` and p

     opulates values via `updateCreditData()`
  4. User selects:
     - Apply → `true`
     - Skip → `false`

  The resolved value is stored as:` applyCredit`
</Accordion>

### Data Preparation for the Checkout Link

The following data is collected before generating the checkout link:

| Field            | Purpose                                                       |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| checkoutId       | Existing checkout session ID (from localStorage, if resuming) |
| label            | Human-readable description (Location \| Level \| Time)        |
| classUniqueId    | Selected class identifier                                     |
| location         | Selected location                                             |
| memberId         | Webflow member ID                                             |
| upsellProgramIds | Selected supplementary programs                               |
| has_fee          | Indicates new student fee                                     |
| source           | Always `cart_page`                                            |
| amount           | Final amount (in cents)                                       |
| applyCredit      | Credit usage flag                                             |
| successUrl       | Redirect after payment success                                |
| cancelUrl        | Redirect if payment is cancelled                              |

### **Stripe Checkout – Customer Data Flow for Class Registrations**

When the student form is submitted, the API `checkoutUrlForClasses` is called. This API generates a `checkoutId` and inserts two initial records into the `stripe_checkout_customer` collection. At this stage, the system stores the `checkoutId`, `customerId`, `paymentType`, `memberId`, `studentId`, and `parentEmail`.

<Note>
  TODO:

  1. **Why two? Is one for bank transfer, and one for Credit Card. If so, make this clear\>**
  2. **What is customerId? Never explained, you can handle this in the TODO below.**
</Note>

### API Call and Response

After this, the user selects the class details along with optional upsells. These selections are sent to the API `updateDataToCheckoutUrl` or `checkoutUrlForUpsellProgram` (difference discussed below) with the `classId`, `bundleId`, and `briefsId`. These APIs create a Stripe checkout session for payment and update the existing records in the `stripe_checkout_customer` collection via the `checkoutId`. The updated data includes the `checkoutUrl` for card or bank transfer, `classId`, `sessionId`, a readable label such as “Fort Lee | Level 2A | Saturday 2:15 PM – 4:15 PM”, `topicIds`, `upsellProgramIds` for bundle programs, and any applied discount amount.

<Note>
  TODO: This is better. I want you to describe the stripe_checkout_customer schema, and explain **when** each field is added/updated. You can do this in the below table
</Note>

| Field | Purpose | Step Added |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- |
|       |         |            |
|       |         |            |

Depending on the purchase type, one of two APIs is called:

#### 1. Standard Checkout (`updateDataToCheckoutUrl`)

This API endpoint is used for normal class registration OR bundled (e.g., pre-registered) purchases.

#### 2. Standard Checkout with any Upsell (`checkoutUrlForUpsellProgram`)

- This API endpoint is used for upsells with bundled semesters or briefs
- **_We are using this API on the portal purchase as well._**

Regardless of which API is used, the return signature is:

```
{
  "success": true,
  "cardUrl": "https://checkout.stripe.com/...",
  "achUrl": "https://checkout.stripe.com/..."
}
```

> There are additional fields for bundle purchases:
>
> - `paymentId` – Bundle payment identifier
> - `isBundleProgram` – Boolean flag
> - `topics` – Selected brief topics (if applicable)

<Note>
  TODO: Unclear where these additional fields are used, given the new updates. Please add them to the correct section with appropriate context.
</Note>

### Redirect to Stripe

Payment URLs are assigned as `href` values on the **Pay Now** buttons, redirecting users based on the selected method (Credit Card → `cardUrl`, Bank Transfer → `achUrl`). Before redirecting, the cart sets `backbuttonstate = "1"` and saves the current checkout data to `localStorage`. This enables checkout recovery in cases such as using the browser back button, cancelling on Stripe, or network interruptions.

<Note>
  TODO: It might be worth us explaining what checkout data gets saved to localStorage, but I'm not sure. Let's skip for now.
</Note>

## Returning from Stripe

There are several return scenarios, each of which are detailed in the following:

### 1. Successful Payment

During the checkout session creation, we provide Stripe the success URL and cancel URL. After a successful payment, it redirects to the success URL with `urlParam`: **payment-confirmation?type=Academic&programName=&pType=**

- **Type(Academic | Summer)**: We have the same payment confirmation for both summer and academic registration. The type indicates which registration the payment confirmation is from. Currently, we use this for tracking purposes and (Google) analytics.
- **programName**: Class or Program Name: This will be displayed on the payment confirmation page.
- **Type**: Payment mode(Card | Bank Transfer). We use this for tracking purposes and (Google)  analytics.

At this point, the payment is confirmed and the registration is completed. The system updates the payment status in the `stripe_checkout_customer` collection to either `Processing` or `Completed` using the `sessionId` that was created during the checkout session. At the same time, a new record is inserted into the `payment_details` collection to store the transaction information. Post payment, several other operations take place, all described here **\<TODO: SK to link to doc when ready\>**.

After successful payment, **we delete the local data** cached during the checkout process, like `checkoutData` and `referralData`.

### 2. Cancelled Payment

When the user clicks the **Back** button on the Stripe checkout page, Stripe redirects them to the **cancel URL** with the parameter `CART_PAGE_URL?returnType=back`. Using this parameter, the cart page detects a back-navigation scenario and restores the last selected class, time slot, and bundle programs so the user can continue checkout seamlessly.

### 3. Browser Back Button

If the user clicks the **browser's** back button on Stripe, they are redirected  to the original cart URL. On page load, the checkout page detects if **backbuttonstate === "1"** and if there's valid checkout data (in `localStorage`). Then, it restores the last selected class, time slot, and bundle programs so the user can continue checkout seamlessly.
