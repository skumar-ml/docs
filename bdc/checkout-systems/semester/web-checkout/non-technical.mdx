## Non-Technical: Checkout Flow

The checkout flow follows a **multi-step form**:

1. Login / Sign-up via cart page
1. Student Details
2. Optional Bundle Program Selection
3. Class Selection & Payment

Each step must be completed before moving to the next.

### Step 1: Login / Sign-up via the cart page

When a user reaches the **Cart flow**, they must create or access a **Parent Account** before continuing.

**Option 1: Existing Parent (Login)**

- At the top of the page, the user sees:\
  **“Already have an account?”** with a **Login** button.
- Clicking **Login** opens a **login modal**.
- The parent enters their credentials and logs in.
- On successful login, the user automatically advances to the **Student Details** step.

**Option 2: New Parent (Create Account)**

- If the user does not have an account, they complete the **Create Account** form.
- On successful account creation:
  - The parent account is created and logged in automatically.
  - The flow advances to the **Student Details** step.

### Step 2: Student Details

Parents begin by entering or selecting student information.

**Saved Student Profiles**: A dropdown allows parents to select an existing student profile. Selecting a saved student automatically fills in the form fields.

**Student Information Fields**:

- First & Last Name
- Email Address
  - If the student does not have an email, the parent’s email can be used.
- Student Grade, School, & Gender
- Has your child participated in a BDC class before?

**Next Button**

- Clicking **Next** saves the student information.
- After saving, a popup appears to offer discounted bundle programs for future sessions.

### Step 3: Bundle Program (Optional)

A popup appears allowing families to pre-register for future sessions at a discounted rate.

**Bundle Options:** Users can select one or more future sessions to bundle.

**Skipping the Bundle:** Users can skip this step by clicking **“No Thanks”**. The checkout process continues whether or not a bundle is selected.

### Step 4: Class Selection & Payment

**Select Class Location:** Users must first choose a location (e.g., Glen Rock, Fort Lee, Livingston, Online)

**Select Class Time:** Available time slots appear after selecting a location. Example times:

- Friday 4:00 PM – 6:00 PM
- Sunday 9:30 AM – 11:30 AM

**Seat Availability Messages**

Depending on how many spots are left in the class, users may see messages such as:

- **Limited Availability:** "Hurry! Register now. Seats filling up fast! Only 1 spot left.”
- **Sold Out:** “Seats are full. You can fill out the waitlist form.”

<Warning>
  TODO: What is the difference (in trigger conditions between the bottom two)? We should note all potential messages the user may see, as well as what the trigger is
</Warning>

## Payment Options

Payment options become available once a class time and location are selected and seats are available. We support **Bank Transfer** and **Credit Card** payment methods. To pay, users:

1. Select a payment method & click **Buy Now**.
3. They are **redirected to a secure Stripe checkout page**, where they enter payment details & complete payment

### After Payment

Upon successful payment, the user is redirected to a [confirmation (success) page](https://www.bergendebate.com/payment-confirmation?type=Academic&programName=Glen%20Rock%20%7C%20Level%201A%20%7C%20Saturday%209:30AM%20-%2011:30AM&pType=card&transactionID=cs_live_b1ZBFBo5RsbbfPvJHdutwSFnk3f0oGxPQTZbsVAqgoGR5YxQJbk4zYt3IW). The student is officially registered for the class.

## Additional UI Elements of Checkout Flow

**Bundle Program Banner:** On the class level & location select screen. This displays the currently (if there are any) selected bundle programs. It allows users to add or remove their selections prior to payment.

**Bergen Briefs:** On the right-hand sidebar, optional learning briefs can be added alongside class registration. Users can choose full or light versions.

**Student Info Panel:** Displays the selected student’s information for confirmation, also allowed to edit the student's information.

TODO: Does it allow for editing? Or just display?

**Order Details Panel:** Shows:

- selected class, time and location
- any upsells (bundle future semesters or briefs)
- pricing and totals

<Note>
  The pricing on the order details dynamically updates based on the payment method selected by the user. The default pricing shown is for Bank Transfer.
