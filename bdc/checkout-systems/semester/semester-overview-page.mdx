## Classes Overview Page

Most checkout journeys begin from the [Semester Overview page](https://www.bergendebate.com/classes-overview). This page displays class offerings for a selected semester (e.g., Winter/Spring 2026, Fall).

The Semester Overview page is divided into two main tabs: **GRADES 5–8** and **GRADES 9+**. Each tab displays a list of class levels with expandable rows for additional details.

### Data Sources Overview

| Data Type                 | Source                 |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------- |
| Class Level & Metadata    | Webflow CMS            |
| Syllabus Details          | MongoDB (via API)      |
| Class Location & Schedule | MongoDB (via API)      |
| Registration Flow         | Cart / Checkout System |

### Class Level & Metadata

Inside each grade tab, classes are displayed by **Level** with basic information provided from the Webflow CMS. These fields are:

- Level Name, Prerequisite, Suggested Grades

### Syllabus Details

The syllabus details are viewable by clicking on a **button** (which is present for each class level). The class syllabus content is loaded dynamically from MongoDB (Retrieved via API based on the selected class level).

### Class Location & Schedule (Expandable Row)

When a class level row is clicked, it expands to show:

- Class locations (e.g., Fort Lee, Glen Rock, Livingston)
- Days and times for each location

The data is retrieved from MongoDB via an API that filters according to

- Class level, Semester, and Grade tab selection

### Register Button

Displayed as a **Register** button for each class level. When clicked, the user is redirected to the **cart page** to register for the selected class. Registration and cart logic handled by the enrollment system

## Technical Details

### APIs & Backend Overview 

Single API Endpoint: **getClassDetails** fetches all class-level data in one consolidated response, including: 

- Class levels, locations & timings, prerequisites, syllabus details (descriptions & accomplishments) 

### Frontend

Uses inline JavaScript to call API, cache data client-side, and render the DOM. The **Key Methods** are:

1. `fetchData(endpoint)` — Generic method for calling the backend API. 
2. `renderPortalData()` — Triggered on page load to fetch and render all class data. 
3. `viewClassLocations(classData)` — Updates the DOM with class locations and timing information. 
4. `openSyllabusModal(levelId)` — Opens the syllabus modal using cached API data. 
5. `initSyllabusModal()` — Attaches click handlers to syllabus trigger elements. 

### **Page Load Behavior**

On the **Initial Page Load**, all content is fetched once and then rendered. Instantiating classLists triggers renderPortalData(). Then, one API request to getClassDetails?levelId= retrieves all levels. The full response is stored in this.cachedApiData. 

While content is being fetched, our **Loading State** uses a loading spinner (half-circle-spinner). 

**Post Load**, cached data is reused for syllabus modals; no additional API calls are made after the initial load.

### Student Graphic Info Form

<Note>
  TODO: Let's revisit the Student Graphic Info Form at a later time. I think the whole thing (form + graphic) deserves its own page.
</Note>

**Features**

**Form Fields**

- Student Details: First & Last Name, Grade
- Parent Details: Name, Email, Phone Number
- Semester (Fall, Winter/Spring, Summer) & Location (Fort Lee, Glen Rock, Livingston, Online) 

**Functionality**

(TODO: finish this later...) On submit, we do field validation (e.g., all fields required). Data is saved to localStorage as **formData**. Then, we call API [studentGraphicInfo](https://b4z5gqv2xj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/camp/studentGraphicInfo)  (while executing, we are displaying loading spinner)

- Phone number formatting and validation (US format) 
- Form validation (all fields required) 
- localStorage support (saves/loads form data) 
- API integration (submits to studentGraphicInfo endpoint) 
- Success/error message display 
- Loading spinner during submission
