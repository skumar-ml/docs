## How User Enrolls in Waitlist System

If the class is full during checkout, the user will see an option to enroll in the class's "Waitlist".

**TODO: Can Techment confirm that there is no limit to the number of classes a user can join the waitlist for?**

<Danger>
  TODO: The Waitlist system page on Retool is not showing the proper details on the "Students List". Please update this.
</Danger>

## Admin Management

Admin can view all users in waitlist for classes through the [Waitlist Center](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/6d587fde-b8a9-11f0-abcf-4f17f8e87830/Student%20Consolidation/Waitlist_Center_Speedup%20-%20SC). Only classes with users in the waitlist are shown here.

**If the admin invites a user**, we _reserve_ the open spot for the user. <u>The admin can only invite the user if they is an open spot in the class!</u> The user (who must be logged into that account) is able to checkout for the class as normal. Any other user will see that the class is full and be prompted to join the waitlist.

<Note>
  Remember to uninvite the user for the class if they are no longer interested to free the spot. Another option is to open the slot to the public after reserving it for 48 hours.
