title: "Semester Bundles (also Summer)"
---

This doc focuses on how upsells are handled **after a purchase** is made. The [semester checkout docs](/bdc/checkout-systems/semester/web-checkout/technical/pre-payment) explain how bundles are handled during the checkout process (rendering the bundle upsell, and bundle selection logic). 

TODO: Write a technical explanation of how bundle purchases are handled differently... specifically, the fact that we insert two records, where the bundle record has no program yet chosen (which is used during pre-reg -- can link to those docs). Make sure to write about any distinction between semester bundle and summer, in terms of DB.
