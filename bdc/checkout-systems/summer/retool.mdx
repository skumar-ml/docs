Admin can control and see the following via Retool:

- [**Create/Edit Summer Sessions**](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/5db11d48-e164-11ee-9a53-6f7bdd96bc91/BCDC%20Phase%205B/Create_Class_No_Instructor): Controls the session name, start & end dates, and programs offered in that session.
- [Add, Modify, or Delete an Offering](https://bergendebate.retool.com/apps/a05a5c6a-b64a-11f0-85e9-afb8c41aac47/Student%20Consolidation/Manage_Class%20-%20SC): Create an offering (a program for a chosen session) at the specified location. Control the number of seats in the offering. 
  - TODO: Similar to before, what happens when you delete a class. What happens to existing students? Is class actually deleted from the DB

<Warning>
  TODO: 

  1. What does Grade Range on the "Create Class" page control??
  2. On the "Inventory Caps" page, user should first set the "Year" and "Session". Then, we should filter the "Program" accordingly and only show "Locations" that have not yet been added.
     1. I don't think we should allow admin to edit the "Year"
</Warning>
