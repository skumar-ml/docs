title: "Technical: Checkout Flow"
---

TODO: Give a technical explanation of how checkout page works (before payment). Explain things that are materially different than how we do them on the semester checkout end. Else, just reference the APIs/codes that accomplish the functionality.

Things to explain are the sign-up / log-in redirect, how session & locations are added in, the number of spots calculation, the code & triggers for code for PF Labs, how Model UN & Young Entreneurship are combined.

<Warning>
  TODO: Need to add the following(Future)

  1. Saved student profiles (similar to semester)
  2. Order session display numerically. This can be done now itself
  3. **View student details in the payment screen**
  4. **Brief upsell**
</Warning>

## Checkout System

TODO: For all of these, reference logics that are similar to semester checkout. Specifically highlight logic that is unique to summer.

### Before Payment

TODO: Explain the payment options, how the checkout links are created, what happens when user is directed to Stripe, what happens if user returns back from Stripe page

The summer checkout supports **two payment methods**, which are shown on the payment step after all required selections are completed.

### 1. ACH Payment (Bank Transfer)

- Paid directly from a bank account
- Uses Stripe’s secure ACH payment flow
- No additional processing fees are applied
- Displays the base program price
- Redirects the user to a Stripe-hosted checkout page to complete payment

ACH payments are often preferred when users want to avoid card processing fees.

---

### 2. Credit / Debit Card Payment

- Paid using a credit or debit card
- Processed securely through Stripe
- Includes a standard card processing fee
- Displays a slightly higher total price due to the fee
- Redirects the user to a Stripe-hosted checkout page for card entry

---

## When Payment Options Appear

Payment options become available only after the user has:

1. Completed the student information form
2. Selected a summer session
3. Selected a location
4. Reached the payment step of the checkout flow

Once these steps are completed, both payment buttons are displayed and the user may choose either option.

---

## How Checkout Links Are Created

Checkout links are created and updated in stages as the user progresses through the checkout flow. This ensures Stripe always has the most up-to-date information.

---

### Step 1: Initial Checkout Creation

**When this happens**\
After the user completes the student information form and clicks **Next**.

**What happens**

- Student details are collected (name, email, grade, school, gender, previous participation)
- Program and pricing information is prepared
- A checkout session is created in Stripe
- Two Stripe checkout links are generated:
  - One for ACH payment
  - One for card payment

This initial checkout session is saved so it can be updated later as the user makes additional selections.

---

### Step 2: Updating Session and Location

**When this happens**\
After the user selects a summer session and location, then clicks **Next**.

**What happens**

- The existing checkout session is updated with:
  - Selected session
  - Selected location
- No new checkout is created — the same session is enhanced with more details

This ensures Stripe reflects the exact program and location the user selected.

---

### Step 3: Final Update Before Redirecting to Stripe

**When this happens**\
When the user clicks either the **ACH** or **Card** payment button.

**What happens**

- Any selected bundle or add-on programs are attached
- Final success and return URLs are confirmed
- The checkout session is finalized
- The user is redirected to Stripe using the selected payment link

At this point, the checkout is fully prepared and ready for payment.

---

## What Happens on the Stripe Checkout Page

Once redirected to Stripe:

1. The user reviews the order summary
2. The user enters payment details:
   - Bank details for ACH
   - Card details for card payments
3. Stripe securely processes the payment
4. Stripe manages the checkout session and transaction

The user may either:

- Complete the payment
- Cancel and return to the site
- Leave the page and return later (session remains active for a period)

---

## What Happens When the User Returns From Stripe

There are multiple return scenarios that the system handles automatically.

---

### 1. Successful Payment

**What happens**

- User is redirected to the payment confirmation page
- The payment is recorded successfully
- The summer program registration is confirmed
- The checkout flow is completed

---

### 2. Cancelled Payment or Manual Return

**What happens**

- User is redirected back to the checkout page
- The system detects the return
- All previously entered information is restored:
  - Student details
  - Selected session
  - Selected location
  - Selected bundle programs
- Payment options are shown again so the user can continue

The user does not need to start over.

---

### 3. Browser Back Button Return

**What happens**

- The system recognizes that the user came back from Stripe
- The checkout state is restored in the same way as a cancelled payment
- The user can resume from where they left off

---

## How Checkout State Is Restored

When a user returns from Stripe, the system:

1. Confirms that a valid checkout session exists
2. Restores student information
3. Restores selected session and location
4. Restores any selected bundle programs
5. Displays the payment step again
6. Updates the order summary with correct pricing

If no valid checkout data is found, the user starts a fresh checkout.

---

## Payment Flow Summary

1. User fills out student details
2. Checkout session is created
3. User selects session and location
4. Checkout session is updated
5. User selects payment method
6. User is redirected to Stripe
7. Payment is completed or cancelled
8. User is redirected back with state restored or confirmation shown

### After Payment

TODO: Explain everything that happens after payment. What APIs get triggered, what writes happen in the DB, where user gets directed after, any automated emails

## 1. API Triggered After Payment

### `stripePaymentListener` (Stripe Webhook)

**Triggered by:**

- Stripe events such as:
  - `checkout.session.completed`
  - `payment_intent.succeeded`
  - Async updates for **Bank Transfer**

**Responsibility:**

- Acts as the single orchestrator for all post-payment logic.
- Calls `updateSummerPayment()` with:
  - `stripeCheckout`
  - `status` (`Complete`, `Processing`, `Failed`)
  - `chargeObj`
  - `sessionId`

---

## 2. High-Level Logic Flow

1. Stripe confirms payment → webhook fires
2. `stripePaymentListener` is invoked
3. `updateSummerPayment()` executes
4. Payment record is inserted or updated
5. Inventory caps are updated
6. Referral & coupon logic runs
7. Emails are triggered
8. User is redirected based on payment type

---

## 3. Database Writes & Updates

### 3.1 `summer_payment_details`

**Insert (first successful payment):**

- payment_intent
- programId
- studentId
- memberId
- yearId
- summerSessionId
- locationId
- amount
- couponCode (if any)
- UTM source
- createdOn

**Update (subsequent webhook calls):**

- status
- receipt_url

**Delete (on Failed payment):**

- Existing `summer_payment_details` record is removed

---

### 3.2 `stripe_checkout_customer`

Updated on **every webhook event**:

- payment_intent
- status (`Complete`, `Processing`, `Failed`)

---

### 3.3 Inventory Management (`updateSummerInventoryCaps`)

- **On Failed payment**
  - Inventory is **released** (`eventType = add`)
- **On Complete / Processing**
  - Inventory is **consumed** (`eventType = minus`)

This ensures real-time seat availability for summer programs.

---

### 3.4 Referral & Coupon Handling

**If coupon was used:**

- Referral marked as `Purchased`
- `purchased_date` updated

**If no existing coupon for family:**

- New coupon code is generated
- Coupon created in **Stripe**
- Coupon stored in `coupon_details` with:
  - coupon_code
  - familyId
  - createdOn

---

### 3.5 `coupon_details`

- New coupon inserted **only once per family**
- Used for future referrals and discounts

---

### 3.6 Upsell Programs

If upsell programs were purchased:

- Records inserted via `addUpsellToPaymentDetails()`

---

### 3.7 Credit Balance Updates

If discount / credit was applied:

- `updateCreditBalance()` updates remaining credits
- Linked to:
  - yearId
  - currentSessionId

---

## 4. Automated Emails

### Admin Emails

- **Sent on:**
  - Card payment → `Complete`
  - Bank transfer → `Processing`
- Triggered via:

  ```
  sendSuccessEmailToAdmin(stripeCheckout, yearId)
  
  ```

### User Emails

- Stripe receipt generated automatically
- `receipt_url` stored in MongoDB

---

## 5. User Redirection After Payment

### Card Payments

- Redirected immediately to **Success / Thank You page**

### Bank Transfer Payments

- Redirected to **Processing / Pending Confirmation page**
- Final confirmation happens asynchronously via webhook

---

## 6. Failure Handling

If payment fails:

- `summer_payment_details` record deleted
- Inventory restored
- Checkout marked as Failed
- No enrollment or coupon generation occurs

---

## 7. Key Characteristics

- Fully **webhook-driven**
- **Idempotent** via `payment_intent`
- Supports **async bank transfers**
- Inventory-safe
- Referral-safe
- Retry-safe
