## Summer Overview Page

Most checkout journeys begin from the [summer overview page](https://www.bergendebate.com/classes-overview).

The **Summer Semester Overview page** displays a list of available summer programs.\
All program-level information on this page is **fully driven by Webflow CMS collections**. Each row on the page represents one Webflow collection item (one summer program). The collection item contains structured fields that control what appears on the overview page and what expands when a program row is clicked.
